**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

DevTools is useful because it allows you to manipulate elements temporarily. You can change the CSS to play around with layout, size, color, etc. It is also helpful because you can hover over an element and see it's current paddings/margins, and you can select elements simply by clicking on them. It is a fast and efficient tool that helps us make changes to our code and immediately see the result.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

You can resize elements using height and width properties. You can also resize elements by editing the padding, as that will change the element size around the content.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find the easiest? Which was most difficult?**

Absolute positioning is when elements are placed relative to their nearest positioned ancestor. I found this to be the most difficult to use, because you have to know which element it's using as reference. Fixed positioning was definitely the easiest for me; elements are placed relative to the entire browser window. It's easy to place footers and navigation menus this way. The element will not move if you scroll through the page. Static positioning is the default position of all elements. These elements will render in order as they appear in the document. Relative positoning will position an element relative to it's container and where it would fall if it's position was static.

**What is the difference between margin, padding, and border?**

The margin is the area around the outside of the element. It moves elements closer to or further away from it's surrounding elements. It's generally used to add space between elements. Padding is the area around the content of the element. It can be used to make elements bigger or smaller. The border is the area around the outside of the content and padding.

**What was your impression of this challenge overall?**

I loved this challenge! It helped solidfy my understanding of positioning with CSS. It was also quick and fun to see an immediate response to changing the CSS in the DOM.
