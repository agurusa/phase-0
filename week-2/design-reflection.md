  <h1> Design Reflection </h1>
<p>
The 6 Phases of Web Design are as follows: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Information Gathering</li>
    <p>
    This phase is important because it helps you understand your client and their needs. It essentially requires an interview that asks your client questions such as,
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Who is the audience for your website?
    </li>
    <li>Do you want to represent yourself as a large corporation, or a small family company?
    </li>
    <li> Do you have any personal photos you'd like to incorporate, or should we use stock photos?
    </li>
    <li> What is the purpose of your website? Do you want people to contact you directly? Do you want them to purchase items from your store?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Planning</li>
  <p>
    This stage is about using what you learned in Stage 1 and putting together a plan for the website. A site map is generally the easiest and most efficient way to do this. A site map will show you the layout of your website, and will give you a clear understanding of where the content you discussed with your client will end up. During this stage, it is important to think about the audience of the website. If the site map is confusing (containing too many main tabs, containing too few subcategories, etc.), the site will not be accessible to your target audience.
  </p>
  <li>Design</li>
  <p>
    Designing a website is about the user experience and interaction with your website. It is about how engaging your website looks, and whether or not it can immediately capture your target audience's attention. Designers have to understand the composition of good and engaging art to lead the user to the most important parts of the site. This includes creating something called a wireframe, which will help give the client an idea of the layout of their site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The User Experience Design (UEC / UXD) is the artistic process that goes into the usability of your website. The target audience should be able to interact with the website in a way that is easy and efficient, as well as enjoyable. It is an ongoing process that may require test groups, google analytics, SEO management, and the addition of interactive features. Some sites that helped me begin thinking of UEC and compositionally strong designs were:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-35-best-personal-websites-weve-ever-seen"> The 35 Best Personal Websites
    </a></li>
    <li><a href = "http://webbyawards.com/winners/2015/websites/"> Webby Awards
    </a></li>
    <li><a href = "https://www.561media.com/quick-view/"> The web design company I worked for :)
    </a></li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <li>Development</li>
  <p>
    This stage is where the website gets code. Using the graphics designed for the homepage, we can now build a shell for the inner pages of the website, and thus begin creating the pages we made in the site map. They stylize using HTML/CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code can include elements as simple as links, images, and color. It can also include more in depth features, like a shopping cart and interactive contact pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this phase, we should also think about a Content Management System, or CMS. A CMS can be something like Wordpress that keeps track of the pages in your website and gives the content a place to "live" and get edited. A CMS like Wordpress allows the client to continue managing their website, even after development is done pushing it live.
  </p>
  <li> Testing and Delivery </li>
  <p>
    <i>This is actually the stage that my web design company had the most trouble with, so it makes me the most nervous when I think about building out a website! </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    When we test a website for functionality, we have to think about any users that will be accessing this website. Will the user have the most recent versions of their browers? Will they be accessing the site from their phone or tablet? Will they be able to see and use all the forms/tabs on different sized monitors? Is this an ecommerce site, and if so, do the shopping cart features work?
  </p>
  <p>
    Once testing is complete, we can push the site live. This means that a File Transfer Protocol system (or FTP) is needed to uploaded the site onto a server. The client will need their domain name and hosting services information so the site can actually get up and running!
  </p>
  <li> Maintenance</li>
  <p>
    A website should never be considered "finished." Websites need to stay active and evolving to continue finding new users and come up as relevant on search engines. This can include the constant update of a blog, changes to homepage images, sidebar announcements, or even just content changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CMS can be used to maintain the content of the site, and even some images. However, to make more intricate changes to the homepage design or the addition of non-shell pages, you may have to talk to a developer or designer.
  </p>
</ol>
<p>
  I intend to create a personal website that acts as a representation of my professional and personal development. The main goal is to attract future business leads; my main audience is anyone I can interact with for development and design purposes. This includes future employers and clients.
</p>
<p>
  The primary action for users will be to contact me directly, through either email or phone call. While I do want to incorporate a portfolio, the main goal will be to have the user contact me with interest.
</p>
<p>
  The content of my website will be large, high quality images of my work, a resume, a very short about me section, and contact information. My site map can be found here: <img src ="/week-2/imgs/site-map.png">
</p>
<p>
  As much as I enjoy web design, I find it really tedious to write about in detail. Design is something that comes pretty naturally to me, and it is tiresome for me to articulate what makes a strong design, and what makes a weak one (maybe because it was my job to convince clients that designers know better ;)).
</p>
<p> That being said, I did really like the site map tools that were in this assignment. I also really liked that UEC was described as an ongoing, and analytical process. It can be really difficult to pin down what a client wants AND what works well with the target audience. UEC puts the target audience at the forefront.
