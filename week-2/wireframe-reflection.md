    A wireframe is essentially the skeleton of a website. It is a graphical representation of the functional elements of a website, and is used for planning purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    A wireframe can consist of different versions of planning stages. The first can be a simple sketch that lays out the general page composition. The second could be the addition of headers and footers, and the addition of lorem ipsum text to check for general page usability. The third could be the addition of color schemes. These versions are simply a way to try to improve the usability and beauty of the website.

    There are different tools to get through the wireframing process. Some of them include the use of a grid system so you can easily move into the development process. Some of them are simple sketch programs that allow you to quickly get your thoughts down and easily move through different ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    A wireframe should be an evolving plan. It is not a complete picture of the entire website, but is rather a general overview of page layouts, possible interactive schemes (how buttons will react when moused over, etc.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Wireframing allows us to work on a website in a series of small steps. We can determine our development needs and programming requirements, acquire new developers, and work as a team that's on the same page. It also allows us to test the composition of navigation menus, content pages, and landing pages, and efficiently refine these graphics.

    This <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/webwallflower/good-design-faster-slides-failcon-2010">link</a> really helped me understand how to wireframe efficiently. I have a lot of trouble doing quick and easy sketches, and tend to want to snap everything to a grid and plan it perfectly so the development stage will be easier. This means that wireframing takes a very long time for me, and I don't usually save different versions of these files. When I'm sketching quickly, I can take a look at a lot of different versions and determine which one I like the most, and why it might be the most visually appealing.

    This <a href = "http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/30860/what-is-the-difference-between-wireframes-and-mockups">link</a> helped me to understand the difference between wireframes and mock ups. Again, I have a lot of trouble quickly sketching out a website. I tend to get caught up in the details. I had to learn that a mock up is actually the next step of the design process, and a wireframe simply details the functionality of a website.

    I made multiple wireframes for my homepage:
    <img src = "/week-2/imgs/wireframe-index.png">
    and a wireframe for my blog:
    <img src = "/week-2/imgs/wireframe-blog-index.png">
    I had some trouble coming up with a good design the blog page. I referenced <a href = "http://thingsorganizedneatly.tumblr.com/archive#_=_"> this site</a> to try to come up with something. I will probably have to go through multiple iterations before I find something I'm really happy with, but for now I think this has the best functionality and goes well with the layout of the homepage.
  </p>

    I did not really like wireframing. I like thinking about the site, but it is somewhat tiresome to put all of those thoughts on paper first. I have a much easier time planning the website in my head, but I guess that would make it incredibly difficult for anyone to work with me on a team. It was tedious to try to think about how I wanted buttons to react when I hover over them, or to think about exactly what I wanted the buttons to say. I decided that there will have to be different versions of my wireframe, and I will have to slowly edit them as I go.
