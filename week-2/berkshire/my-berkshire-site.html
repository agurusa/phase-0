    REFLECTION

It felt a little weird to write HTML for an actual site. Honestly, it was a bit underwhelming. I felt like there was so much more than I wanted to do to make the website more interesting, or to divide up the information in a more readable or logical way. I just don't seem to have the skillset to do that yet. When we were researching solutions and semantics, we were able to quickly use what we had learned, and also use elements such as headers and footers. It was pretty easy to use HTML5Doctor.com to look at the elements.

I think we did well with keeping to HTML5 standards. We didn't do any real formatting, but we did put things in a heirarchy using things like <h1> or <h2>. HTML is a bit frustrating in this way. While it's great for organizing data, it's incredibly difficult to imagine a complete picture of your website before you add CSS. That being said, the source code is easy to read, even if it can be a bit tedious to write.

I don't have any real tricks, I just refer to some reference sites if something isn't working properly. It was also nice to use the HTML validator to check if everything is coded properly. I also try to make sure that all of my indentations make sense, so I can quickly go through my code and check to make sure all my tags are closed.
